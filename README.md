## Alien Game

### Project Overview

This is a Python-based game created following the guidance and exercises from the book *"Python Crash Course"* by Eric Matthes. This project includes several modifications and enhancements beyond the original book exercises. 

## Features

- **Initial Ship Position**: The starting position of the ship has been altered, affecting the movement of the aliens.
- **Ship Movement**: The ship can now move in all four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- **Stars**: Added as a visual feature and exercise. The game randomly displays 100 stars each time it starts.
- **Gameplay**: The objective is to shoot down aliens. Each time you clear all aliens, you advance to the next level. The game includes a scoring system and you have 4 lives.
- **Design**: The design of the alien and ship sprites was created by me.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Arrow keys to move the ship.
   - Spacebar to shoot.
   - Press Esc to exit the game.
   - Press Q to start the game.

2. **Objective**:
   - Shoot all the aliens to advance to the next level.
   - Avoid letting aliens reach the left edge of the screen.
   - Score points for each alien shot down. 

3. **Levels**:
   - The game becomes progressively harder with each level, with increased speed for the ship, bullets, and aliens.
